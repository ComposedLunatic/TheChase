# TheChase

Game Jam game I worked on as a solo project (except the character art) made in 50 hours. The Chase is a visual novel dating sim where the player is living a normal college life, while love intrests work up the courage to talk with you. Can you tell the diffrence betwen a stalker, abuser and a normal college student?

2. Run Unity and add/load the project. 
3. Have fun and take a look.

### Notes

This project was mostly for fun but also to explore ways I could use Scriptable Objects and different ways to architect code. I've learned with this simple system that seperating things (UI elements, gameplay systems etc.) would help improve functionality plus make the code easier to read. Like seperating the sprite system from the UI Manager so it will manage them all on its own, only taking in some parameters. I also learnt more about how a production pipeline should look (having to do mostly everything on my own), having to decide when I should design something, implement a feature or test a feature. Mostly it was between design and implementing, wondering if I had enough to create something or if I would have stop halfway to design something that would depend on the feature or vice versa. I mean the limited time didn't help there but it was fun either way.
